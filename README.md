# newsy

`newsy` is a command line news client for Reddit and HackerNews that loads the latest stories, displays them in the terminal, and saves them to a file. This program was built as an exercise while working through [Hands-on Concurrency with Go by Leo Tindall](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/videos/hands-on-concurrency-with/9781788993746).

`conewsy` is the IO concurrent version.

`searchy` is a search engine for news stories.

`findy` is a task parallel search engine to the Reddit and HackerNews client. While new stories are being fetched, users can still be making requests to the server (implemented here via `localhost:8080`).
